# LunarVim Config Files 
This is a basic setup I use as my IDE, feel free to copy and change anything.

## How to use
Before continuing, you need [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation) before installing this config 

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/lvim # Make sure your lvim config is deleted. 
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/gasech/lvim-config.git lvim
```
